The RBG format allows a color to be represented as a mixture of red, green, and blue components. Each component can have an integer value in the range [0,255]. Each line in the file contains four fields: red, green, blue, and colorname. Each field is separated by some amount of whitespace (tab or space in this case). The text file is formatted to make it print nicely, but that makes it harder to process by a computer. Note that some color names can also contain a space character.
